## Meeting 2.
* **DATE: 16.2.2024**
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja**

### Minutes
We were missing Flask run command from the README.
There might be too many models im the project and when implementing the project we should consider the amount of work that is needed to be done.
Comment model was not linked to the user model, this should be done.
Despite the sqlite3 database being used, the string(256) were used to store strings in the database. This should be changed to text type.
The project was named 'app' and it should be named differently to avoid confusion e.g. 'bikinghub'.


### Action points
 - Add Flask run command to the README.
 - Consider the amount of work that is needed to be done when implementing the models.
 - Link the comment model to the user model.
 - Change the string(256) to text type in the database.
